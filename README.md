The Odin Project | HTML Foundations Project

This project will demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML principles
as outlined in The Odin Project HTML Foundations curriculum. Concepts
include:
    - Elements and Tags
    - Creating an HTML Boilerplate
    - Adding Text
    - Adding Ordered and Unordered Lists
    - Links and Images

Furthermore, this project will encourage the use of git commands while
learning the GitHub website and proper version control practices.
