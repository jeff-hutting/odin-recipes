  <h2 class="heading-2">Description:</h2>
    <p>If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique
        for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It
        starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the
        oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized
        crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior.</p>
  <h2 class="heading-2">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>2 beef Ribeye Steaks</li>
      <li>2 cups Orange Juice</li>
      <li>1 cup Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Worcestershire Sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Steak Seasoning (or to taste)</li>
      <li>Ground Pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Olive Oil</li>
      <li>Sea Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
  <h2 class="heading-2">Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="list">
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 Â½ minutes.</li>
      <li>Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
