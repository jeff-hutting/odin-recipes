            <li>4 large Baking Potatoes</li>
            <li>8 slices Bacon</li>
            <li>1 cup Sour Cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Milk</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons Butter</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup Shredded Cheddar Cheese, divided</li>
            <li>8 Green Onions, sliced, divided</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients and preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes. Set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins.</li>
            <li>Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions to the potato; mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.</li>
            <li>Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.</li>
            <li>Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Serve Hot!</li>
        </ol>
